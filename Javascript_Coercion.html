    <h1>Javascript Coercion : Why and How???</h1>
<pre>Being new to javascript, I found coercion and all about javascript being loosely typed quite confusing. I'll try to make things clear on how coercion works in javascript using examples.

Case 1: Type of x is the same as type of y
NaN (Not a Number) is not equal to NaN. So NaN==NaN returns false
null is  equal to null. null==null returns true
Similarly undefined is equal to undefined and undefined==undefined returns true
When x is the same number as y, 4==4 returns true. (as expected)
+0 and -0 are also equal. +0==-0 returns true
For strings, True is returned only when both the strings are exactly the same. (as expected)
Boolean - Returns true when both x and y are either true or false. (as expected)


Case 2: x is null and y is undefined. null is equal to undefined and null==undefined returns true. So remember that "if (a==undefined) || (a==null)" is the same as "if (a==null)".

Case 3: x is number and y is string. In this case, javascript will actually perform x==ToNumber(y). Hence 9=='9' returns true.

Case 4:  x is boolean and y is a number. Here comparing (0,false) and (1,true) will only return true, as expected.

Case 5: x is boolean and y is string. Javascript performs x=ToNumber(y). So again (false,'0') and (true.'1') will only return true.

Hope you find this helpful. Please do provide your inputs to improve this material further.

Thanks and Happy Learning ! :-)</pre>
