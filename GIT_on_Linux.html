    <h1>GIT on Linux – The 15 minute guide to getting started</h1>
<pre>Hi All,

Here's a step by step guide to getting started with GIT for Linux. We will go through the steps to set up GIT, create a repository and finally to push code into the repository.

Download and install GIT from http://git-scm.com/download. Once installed, you can use the git –version command on the terminal to confirm and check the version.

Create a Git account at https://github.com/

Create SSH keys by following the steps mentioned below
Check for existing keys using command cd ~/.ssh
Backup existing keys by creating a new directory and copying the existing ids there
mkdir backup
cp id_rsa* backup
rm id_rsa*
Generate new SSH key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C “username@email.com”
Here username@email.com will be your email address. Hit enter to save the key at the default location.
Next it asks for a passphrase where you can enter it or keep it blank.
You should get a notification saying 'Your public key has been saved in...'
Add the SSH key to your github account.
Go to 'Account settings' > 'SSH Keys' on your github account.
Open the 'id_rsa.pub' file that you just generated with a text editor.
Copy the complete contents of the file and past it into the 'Key' field.
Click 'Add Key'
Configure your global username and email
            git config –global user.name “Firstname Lastname”
            git config –global user.email “username@email.com”
Create a new repository
           Create a new repository from https://github.com/repositories/new. I'll name my repository 'gittest'.
  VI. Adding files to the repository
Create a folder with the same name as that of the repository you just created.
    mkdir gittest
Go to the gittest dir
    cd gittest
Initialize GIT using 'git init'
Create a file
    echo “This is a README file” > README.txt
Include the file to be tracked by GIT
    git add .
'git status' shows you the status. At this point, it should be saying something like “Changes to be committed: ...”
Committing the changes
    git commit -m “Any message you like”
Running 'git status' now should say “Nothing to commit”
Linking your application directory to the repository on Github
    git remote add origin git@github.com:your-github-username/gittest.git
Confirm that the directory is now linked to the repository on Github by running 'git remote -v'. Terminal will display the remotes linked to this directory.
Pushing to Github
    git push -u origin master
 
This completes the steps to push your code to Github. To push any further changes you make, you would need to follow the steps mentioned below.
git add .
git commit -m “your message”
git push

You can also replace the commands 1 & 2 with 'git commit -am “your message”'. This will add as well as commit the changes you have done.
