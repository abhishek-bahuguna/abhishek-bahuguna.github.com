    <h1>My 'First date' with CLI</h1>
<pre>For those who are still wondering, CLI is the Command Line Interface.

You might be a bit amused with the weird title, but I found it appropriate to name it this way as this is the first time ever that I have tried out CLI.

<u>Here are few of my observations:</u>

1) For new users, it might take a while to understand the ease and power of CLI.

2) Once you are familiar with the commonly used commands, you can perform many operations much quicker than GUI.
Eg. You can type in a single line command to move/copy a file to a folder 10 folders deep. Imagine Copying the file and then performing10 double clicks before you can paste it again !
Another example would be to append the contents of a file into another by a single line command opposed to opening file > copying > opening another file > pasting.

3) Operations which you can carry out with CLI are much faster compared to GUI. Consider searching a part of text in a folder having many text files.

4) It also provides an option to take the output of one command and use it as the input to another. How cool is that !

5) CLI uses much less resources compared to a GUI.


I have not gone into the details of each and every command that you can use with CLI as there are a lots of such materials available on the internet.
Here are a few links that you can use to start with the command line.
